## Overview
I have just created This project
#install
express & body-parser&cors 
I created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 
This program will apear the data and the temprature of the country after clicking on the generator button 
 

## Instructions
I modified the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
